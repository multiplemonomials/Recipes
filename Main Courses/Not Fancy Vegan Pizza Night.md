# Not-Fancy Vegan Pizza Night

As I've learned to cook, pizza was something I initially tended to avoid.  In my family, growing up, it tended to be a Big Deal that required loads of prep, special tools, and a favor owed to everyone involved.  It was a delicious affair, to be sure, but not one that could be attempted lightly.  Since I don't really have the space for a pizza stone or a pizza oven, pizza was definitely not something that could be attempted by a mere mortal like me.

However, as I have learned more recently, pizza... doesn't have to be complicated.  It can actually be fairly simple.  So long as you start the dough ahead of time, making pizza can actually be one of the more efficient ways to feed 6-8 people at a time.  Yes, you have to give up a bit of authenticity, but it _is_ possible to replicate the cheesiness, breadiness, and delicious flavor of pizza right in your own home with little to no special equipment.  The only things you really, absolutely need are a rolling pin, a high speed blender or food processor (for the fake cheese), and a regular oven with regular cookie sheets.

Note that this recipe is tailored to me and my girlfriend's dietary restrictions: I'm vegan, and she eats whole wheat only.  So, this recipe is vegan, and the crust uses mostly whole wheat flour (you still have to include *some* white flour in there, or the recipe won't work).  I'm not claiming that this is the best way to make pizza, or even that this is the best way to make it following our dietary restrictions, but it's how I've been doing it and it generally works quite well!

For this recipe, the toppings are customizeable.  I quite like having some veggies, like onions and bell peppers, plus some sort of fake meat.  Happily, in 2024, there are lots of options available for fake meat!  Impossible Meat gives heartiness while having a relatively neutral flavor.  Impossible Sausage adds a spicy kick (too spicy for my girlfriend!) and is great if you're used to something like chorizo.  Meanwhile, Beyond Meat has a stronger beefy flavor and is delish in big chunks.

## Tools Required
- Mixer with regular beater and dough hook attachments (though you can also knead the dough by hand if you wish)
- High-speed blender or food processor (for the cheeze)
- 2 cookie sheets
- Rolling pin
- Pizza cutter (though you can also get by with a knife)

## Yield:
Two cookie-sheet size, medium crust pizzas.  At least 6 full meals.

## Time Required:
- ~20 min to mix the dough
- 1h 45min for the dough to rise (you can also prep everything else during this)
- ~30 min to assemble and cook the pizzas

## Directions:
1. First, we will start the yeast mixture.  Mix the sugar into the warm water with a spoon, and then sprinkle the yeast on top.  Let stand for 10 minutes.  The mixture should be foamy and smell yeasty -- if not, your yeast may have expired!
2. Now, add the salt and olive oil into the yeast mixture and stir to combine.  Add the yeast mixture and flours into a mixer bowl.  Fit the mixture with the paddle attachment and beat on low for ~1 min, until the flour and liquids are combined.  If you don't have a mixer, instead mix with a spoon.
3. Then, swap to the dough hook attachment and follow your mixer's instructions to knead the dough (for my KitchenAid, this means setting it on speed 2 for ~8 minutes).  If you don't have a mixer, instead knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes.  When done, the dough should have formed into a ball and be tacky, but not sticky -- it should feel wet to the touch but should spring back when you press on it.  You may need to add additional flour or water to get the consistency right.
4. Pour olive oil into the mixer bowl and spin the dough so that the bowl and dough are coated in oil.
5. Let stand for 1 hour, covering with a towel to prevent drying out.  In the meantime, you can work on preparing the cheese and chopping veggies.
6. Once the dough has finished rising (it should have approximately doubled in size), turn out onto a floured surface and divide in half using a knife.
7. Place the dough balls back into the oiled mixer bowl and ensure they are still coated in oil.
8. Let stand for 45 min, covering with a towel.
9. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees C.
10. While the dough is rising, finish any remaining prep.  Chop up all the veggies and make the cheeze.  (Note: don't put the cheeze in the fridge; it will get too thick.  Keep it out on the counter).
11. Also, take the time now to fry up the meat.  Heat up a saucepan, pour in a bit of oil, and crumble the meat into it.  Saute for 8-12 minutes, until the meat reaches an acceptable level of brownness.
12. Once the dough has finished rising, prepare your counter with a generous amount of dusted flour, and then turn out one of the dough balls onto it.
13. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough so it's the same size as your cookie sheet.
14. Dust the top of the cookie sheet with an even coating of cornmeal, if using (this is how restaurants get that gritty texture on the bottom of the pizza)
15. To transfer the dough to the cookie sheet, dust the top of the dough with flour (this is important, or it will get stuck).  Then, roll the dough up, coiling it around the rolling pin.  You can then unroll it onto the cookie sheet, moving from one end to the other.
16. To create the crust, move around the edge of the pizza with your fingers, pinching the dough into a thicker ridge.  Then brush with olive oil.
17. Pour one cup of the marinara sauce onto the dough and spread it around with a spoon so it's as even as you can get it.  Then pour on half the still-liquid cheeze.
18. Now it's time to add toppings.  Add the crumbled meat and whatever veggies and spices you wish.  Finish it off with the pizza seasoning.
19. Place the pizza in the oven for 15-20 min, until crisp and browned at the edges.
20. While the first pizza is cooking, repeat steps 13-19 for the next pizza.
21. When each pizza is done, remove it from the oven and slice into pieces with a pizza cutter or knife.
