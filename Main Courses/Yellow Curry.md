# Yellow Curry

Yellow curry feels.. unappreciated, at times.  I have a couple cookbooks with recipes for red and panang curries, but had yet to encounter a recipe for yellow curry.  And yet, yellow curry is actually one of my favorites; I get it quite often at restaurants as I love the non-spicy, tangy, complex flavor.  That's why I was quite excited to try out the recipe I found (linked below) for vegan yellow curry.  And it did not disappoint!  It absolutely succeeded in bringing back that taste I know and love from thai restaurants.  However, the directions there could be rewritten a bit clearer, so I am writing up this recipe to provide my own spin on this delicious curry.

Modifications made: Added oil to the curry paste, added potatoes and onion to the curry, added lime juice to the broth, improved descriptions and general documentation.

## About This Recipe
Yellow curry, I believe, is a pretty forgiving dish.  As long as you have the core flavors of the curry (lemongrass and coconut milk), most other things are negotiable.  This recipe has the veggies I like in a curry, but you can also substitute according to what you like, e.g. more bell peppers, add mushrooms, no green beans, etc.

As far as the meat/protien, this again can be swapped out according to what you like.  You may just want veggies, or you could use steamed or restaurant style fried tofu (see the [eggplant tofu recipe](https://github.com/multiplemonomials/Recipes/blob/master/Main%20Courses/Restaurant%20Style%20Eggplant%20Tofu.md)), or you could use another type of fake meat such as seitan or storebought fake chicken.  I'll leave this recipe pretty open ended in that regard.

As far as quantities, it's worth noting that the curry paste recipe makes enough for 4 batches of curry.  So I hope you're hungry!!  jkjk, you should be able to save it for a while in the fridge or freezer and use it to make more curry later.

Last but not least, the ingredients.  *Most* of the stuff in this recipe is pretty standard, but there are three curry paste ingredients that can cause trouble: galangal (which is like a sort of pine flavored ginger), lime leaves, and lemongrass.  You will probably have to go to an asian supermarket for those: in my experience, H-Mart carried all three, but 99 Ranch did not have lime leaves.  If you can't get the lime leaves, this recipe is still good without them, so don't give up just because of that.  Also note that the galangal, lemongrass, and lime leaves can be frozen and reheated next time you make this, so you don't have to waste them even if they only sell them in large quantities.

## Yield:
5-6 full servings

## Time:
Prep: ~45 min

Cooking: ~45 min

## Ingredients:
### Yellow Curry Paste (makes 10 tbsp)
- 2 lemongrass stalks
- 3 bird's eye or serrano peppers, deseeded and chopped (even with the full amount of peppers, this is still NOT a very spicy dish, don't forget these peppers are split across 4 batches of curry!)
- 1 medium shallot, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, chopped
- 4 slices (2-3mm thick) galangal, peels sliced off
- 1 inch ginger, peeled and chopped
- 2 kaffir AKA makrut lime leaves, stems removed
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp curry powder
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp cumin powder
- 0.5 tsp white pepper
- 1 tsp miso paste
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp refined coconut oil, melted

### Broth
- Refined coconut oil, for frying
- 1.5 lbs potatoes, peeled and cut into 2cm chunks (russet preferred)
- 1 small yellow onion, chopped into large pieces
- 2.5 tbsp yellow curry paste (see above!)
- 1 can (400mL) regular coconut milk (not lite coconut milk or coconut cream!)
- 1.5 cups vegetable broth
- 1 tbsp tamari (Japanese soy sauce, e.g. kikkoman)
- 2 tsp sugar (or 0.75 tsp stevia)
- 1 tbsp lime juice (~1 smallish lime), plus additional lime wedges for serving (optional)

### Veggies, Protien, and Extras (customize as needed!)
- 0.75 cup (~1/2 can) bamboo shoots, drained and sliced into long fettucine-style pieces
- 0.5 cup green beans, ends removed and cut into 1" pieces
- 2 medium carrots, sliced into ~4mm thick discs
- 1 red bell pepper
- about 1 lb tofu or fake meat, as desired (see "About This Recipe" above)
- 0.5 cup chopped cilantro for garnish (if desired, I personally don't think it really needs this)
- white rice (perhaps 1.5 cups dry AKA 2 Zojirushi cups)
- Chili flakes for topping (optional)

## Directions:
### Yellow Curry Paste
1. Prepare the lemongrass stalks by peeling off the outer few layers until a tender, smooth surface is exposed.  Then, slice off and discard the green parts at the tops, keeping only the white and very light green parts (bottom 5-6 inches).  Next, slice off the roots at the base.  Finally, chop them into thin slices.
2. Add the lemongrass and all remaining curry paste ingredients to a small food processor and process until you obtain a smooth paste.  Note that you probably can't use a blender for this as it's not very liquid -- a food processor is a must.  If you are having trouble getting it to process, you can add a bit more melted coconut oil or some water.

### Yellow Curry
1. Do the prep:
    1. Start the rice cooking if using.
    2. Press tofu if needed.
    3. Prepare the potatoes and onion for the broth.
    4. Prepare the veggies so that they're ready to add when you need them.
    5. Preheat a large pot over medium heat.
    6. Open up the coconut milk can and stir it so that it's ready to add.
3. Add the potatoes and onions into the pot along with a bit of coconut oil.  Pan fry for a few minutes until the potatoes are starting to get soft (you should be able to stick a fork through them but they should still be a bit tough).
4. Add the curry paste plus 2 tbsp coconut milk and fry for a few minutes, until aromatic.
5. Add the remaining coconut milk and the vegetable broth. Stir and bring to a simmer.
6. Add all the veggies into the pot, and simmer until they are cooked to the desired level of tenderness.  Check after 15 min and see if it's ready or not (I'd recommend trying a potato and a carrot to make sure they are done).  
7. While the veggies are simmering, prepare your tofu or fake meat (e.g. by steaming or pan frying it).
8. Once the veggies are done, add the tofu/fake meat, soy sauce, sugar, and lime juice.
9. Remove from heat, stir, and taste for salt/seasoning.
10. Serve!  Make sure to add rice, cilantro, lime wedges, and/or chili flakes if using!
