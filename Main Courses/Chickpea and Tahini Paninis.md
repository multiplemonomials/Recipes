This recipe is based off of one my friend Chewie at work gave me for spiced chickpea wraps.  I absolutely loved the tahini sauce and how it combined together with chickpeas and veggies to make a delicious combo.  However, I have always been a fan of sandwiches and paninis over wraps.  So, I made my own twist on it!

## Yield: 
4 Sandwiches

## Ingredients:

### Tahini Dressing
- 0.75 cup (120 g) tahini
- 0.5 cup + 1-2 additional tbsp warm water
- 2 tbsp lemon juice (~1/2 large lemon)
- 1.5 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1.5 tbsp olive oil
- 1.5 tsp tamari or Japanese soy sauce
- 2 medium cloves grated garlic
- 0.25 tsp salt (can increase if needed)

### Spiced Chickpeas
- 2 tbsp lemon juice (~1 small lemon)
- 1 tsp maple syrup
- 1 tsp soy sauce or tamari
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 0.25 tsp cayenne pepper
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp olive oil, divided
- 3 cups cooked chickpeas (2 cans)


### Paninis
- Olive oil for brushing
- 8 large slices of bread (sourdough preferred)
- Spinach (a cup or two total)
- Sliced cherry tomatoes (1 cup total)
- Shredded carrots (1 cup total)
- Vegan mayonnaise (a few spoonfuls)
- Optional extra toppings:
  - Sliced cucumber (1-2 persian cucumbers per recipe)
  - Avocado slices

## Directions:


1. Mix all tahini dressing ingredients together until smooth and creamy. Refrigerate.
2. Mix lemon juice, maple syrup, and soy sauce together.
3. In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine papraka, cumin, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and salt with 1 tbsp of the olive oil.
4. Bloom the spices by placing the bowl in a microwave and heating in 30-second increments until the oil is beginning to bubble and the spices are fragrant.
5. Heat the remaining olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat. Add chickpeas and fry until golden (about 3-5 minutes).
6. Pour lemon juice mixture over chickpeas and stir. Wait 30 seconds, then add the bloomed spices.  Stir them in and heat for another minute, then remove the chickpeas from heat.
7. Heat up your panini maker on high.  If you don't have a panini maker, you can improvise by making the paninis in a skillet and using a large pot to smush down the tops.
8. Assemble each panini.  Note that this order is important so that things don't fall off!
    1. Cut two slices of bread in half
    2. Brush oil on the bottom of two of the half slices and place them on the panini maker
    3. On each slice, spread on 2 tbsp of tahini sauce per slice.  It is thick so you may need to use a knife.
    4. Then add 1/4 of the chickpeas, then 1/4 of the tomatoes and carrots to the two slices
    5. Additional toppings can be added at this level or spread on the top slice of bread
    6. Top it off with spinach.  Then, spread mayo on the top slice, place it on top of the sandwich, and brush oil on top of it.
9. Allow the panini to cook for 6-8 minutes.  Once the top and/or bottom bread slice begins to turn golden, remove from heat and serve!
10. Repeat steps 8-9 for the remaining three paninis!
