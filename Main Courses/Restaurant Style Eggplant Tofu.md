This is my twist on Chloe Coscarelli's recipe for sauteed eggplant, combined with Hannah Che's method for creating restaurant-style ("braised") tofu.

## Modified From:
_The Vegan Chinese Kitchen_, p. 149
_Chloe Flavor_, p. 169

## Yield: 
4 servings

## Ingredients:

**Tofu:**
- 1 block firm tofu, cut into ~2" x ~2" x 1/2" rectangular prisms.  Firm preferred but extra-firm will also work.
- Vegetable oil for frying, at least 1/2 cup
- 3 tsp salt

**Sauce:**
- 0.5 cup water
- 3 tbsp tamari
- 3 tbsp [seasoned rice vinegar](https://www.amazon.com/Marukan-Vinegar-Rice-Ssnd-Grmt/dp/B01H4LC276/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2CMLHNFWHY4QU&keywords=seasoned+rice+vinegar&qid=1678423756&s=grocery&sprefix=seasoned+rice+%2Cgrocery%2C154&sr=1-5).  This is a rarer ingredient and is NOT the same as regular rice vinegar.
- 3 tbsp maple syrup
- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- 2.25 tsp sriracha
- 3/8 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- 1.5 tsp (0.5 tbsp) cornstarch

**Stir Fry:**
- 3 long Asian eggplants or 1 American eggplant, cut into ~1.5cm cubes
- 1.5 cups dry white rice (equivalent to 2 Zojirushi rice maker cups)
- 5 green onions, white and green parts thinly sliced, divided in half
- Sesame seeds, for topping

## Directions:

1. First, start the rice cooking in a rice maker or pot.
2. In a saucepan, bring 4 cups water to a boil, and add 2 tsp of salt.  Add in the tofu slices and allow them to steam in the water for 3-5 minutes once the water returns to a boil.  This infuses them with salt, making them extremly tasty.
3. Remove the tofu and allow a few minutes for it to drain/dry.
4. Heat up a wok or frying pan, and add enough vegetable oil to create a 1/4" deep pool of oil (half the height of the slices of tofu).  When the oil is hot and shimmering, add as many tofu pieces as will fit.  Allow the tofu to fry until a golden crust develops on the bottom, ~4 minutes.  Then, flip each piece and fry until the other side looks similar, ~3 minutes.
5. Transfer the fried tofu pieces to a plate with a paper towel on it (which will soak up excess oil).  Then, cut each rectangle in half along its longest diagonal, forming two triangular pieces.
6. Repeat for the remaining tofu until all of it is fried.  Remaining oil can be transferred to a heatproof container, put in the fridge, and reused.
7. In a small bowl, stir together the sauce ingredients and set aside.
8. In the wok or skillet, heat just 2 tbsp vegetable oil over medium-high heat.  When it shimmers, add the eggplant and half the green onions.
9. Cook, stirring every 2 minutes (use a timer!).  Don't worry if it looks like there isn't any oil left in the pan, that's just what eggplant does -- you don't need to add more oil.  Keep cooking until the eggplant is nicely browned (about 10 minutes).
10. Add the sauce, half the green onions, and the tofu to the pan.  Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 10-15 minutes, until the eggplant is soft and the sauce is thick.  The steaming sauce will change the texture of the tofu, making not crunchy and instead giving it that restaurant-style skin and texture.
11. Serve!  Plate into bowls along with the rice, and top with sesame seeds and the remaining green onions.
