## Yield: 2 Servings (~3.25 cups / 770mL broth)

## Ingredients:

- 2 bundles (~75g each) soumen noodles (or can use 8oz fresh ramen noodles)
- Whatever toppings you prefer! (I recommend tofu, cooked fake chicken, green onions, etc)

**Broth:**
- 1 tbsp minced garlic (~3 medium cloves)
- 2 tbsp soy sauce (shoyu).  To make it interesting, can use a mix of Chinese soy sauce (Pearl River Bridge or Lee Kum Kee) and Japanese (Kikkoman).
- 2 tsp mirin
- 2 tsp white sesame seeds
- 0.5 tsp toasted sesame oil
- 3 tbsp red miso or 4 tbsp white miso
- 1.5 tsp (1/2 tbsp) [fake chicken boullion](https://www.amazon.com/Better-Than-Bouillon-Chicken-Certified/dp/B000N7YKQK) [replacing chicken broth in the original recipe]
- 750 mL (3.25 cups) water
- 1 tsp fake butter (e.g. Earth Balance) [this replaces beef tallow in the original recipe]
- 1 tsp [doubanjiang paste](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Plus-Green-Doubangjiang-Ingredient/dp/B08TVHRTDP/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=Doubanjiang&qid=1683396318&sr=8-4) (optional, gives a moderate spice level)

## Directions:

1. First, we will make the easy broth.  Preheat a pot over medium-high heat.
2. In a small bowl, mix together the minced garlic, miso, soy sauce, mirin, sesame seeds, and sesame oil with a fork until combined.
3. Quickly, lightly fry the miso mixture in the pot for a few minutes until the flavor is released, stirring constantly so it doesn't burn.

3. Before it burns, add the water and bring to a boil.
4. Mix in the fake chicken boullion and fake butter.
5. If you like it spicy, add a few teaspoons of doubanjiang paste.
6. In a separate pot, boil up the soumen noodles according to package directions, then drain and transfer to serving bowls.
7. Once the broth is boiling, remove from heat immediately, then add to the bowls when ready.
8. Add preferred toppings!  [Shichimi powder](https://www.amazon.com/cart/smart-wagon?newItems=d6b7f648-b73a-4399-916c-4ed9b437801b,1&ref_=sw_refresh) [Japanese seven-flavor chili powder] is often a good choice.  Chili oil (rayu) is also nice to get that restaurant-style oily appearance.
