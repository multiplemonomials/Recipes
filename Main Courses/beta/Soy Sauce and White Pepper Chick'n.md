Title: Soy Sauce and White Pepper Chick'n
Date: 2025-12-07
Category: Main Dishes

This is based on a recipe called "Stir-Fried Gluten with Ginger & Scallions" in _The Vegan Chinese Kitchen_ by Hannah Che (p. 203). This recipe is super interesting, and I'd really recommend giving it a shot at least once -- it shows how to make seitan (well, specifically, "poached gluten") the way that Chinese Buddhists have been making it for hundreds of years, and then puts this together into a delicious stir fry. The flavors in this dish are simple, yet incredibly well-balanced, with chinese soy sauce, white pepper, ginger, and green onions taking center stage. That recipe, however, is pretty difficult to make, taking at least 3 hours end to end, due to the need to make homemade gluten and knead and stretch it into shape, then deep fry it. I began wondering if there was a way to make something that tasted almost as good, but with less of a time commitment.

The result is this recipe, which is undoubtedly less authentic, but tries to preserve the spirit and flavor of the original while making more food in less time.

# Yield

About 3-4 full meals.

# Ingredients

## Stir Fry
- Oil, for frying
- 24 oz unflavored seitan chicken (or other type of fake chicken), cut into uneven chunks (shoot for roughly ~2cm x 10mm x 5mm, or ~2/3" x 1/3" x 1/4")
    - I usually make my own with [this recipe](https://fullofplants.com/the-best-vegan-chickn/), which makes just enough for 1x batch of this recipe
    - You could also use storebought, just make sure it doesn't have any seasoning yet. We want a blank slate here that we can flavor!
- 6 inches (about 45 grams) ginger root, not peeled, cut into thin strips (see below)
- ~12 green onions, roots removed, sliced into long 2" pieces, white and green parts kept separate
- 1 yellow onion, cut into thin half-moons
- 3 serrano peppers, seeded and cut into thin slices
    - This gives the recipe a medium-low spice level, to me. Feel free to omit to remove the spice, or add more / leave the seeds in for more spice!
- 1 yellow bell pepper, cut into thin slices

## Sauce
- 3 tbsp Chinese light soy sauce [I recommend Pearl River Bridge brand #notsponsored]
- 3 tbsp [vegetarian oyster sauce](https://www.amazon.com/Vegetarian-Mushroom-Oyster-Sauce-35fl/dp/B00LBLYMMO/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1RNNN6LG712U9&dchild=1&keywords=vegetarian+oyster+sauce&qid=1601347380&sprefix=vegetarian+oys%2Caps%2C190&sr=8-3)
- 3 tbsp shaoxing wine
- 2 tsp white sugar
- 0.5 tsp white pepper

## For Serving
- White rice, approx. 1.5 cups dry

# Directions
1. Start the rice cooking, per your usual method
2. In a wok or frying pan, begin heating a few tablespoons of oil for cooking the fake chicken.
3. Prepare your ingredients as described above. To chop the ginger, the recommended method is to slice it into like 3mm (1/8") thick, approximately circular "coins", then slice the coins into strips (stacking a few on top of each other to save time). You can leave the peel on, as, per Hannah's original recipe, it is nutritious and you won't notice it here.
4. (recommended) Sort ingredients into prep bowls as follows:
    - Bowl 1: fake chicken
    - Bowl 2: ginger, green onion whites
    - Bowl 3: green onion greens
    - Bowl 4: onion, serrano peppers
    - Bowl 5: bell pepper
5. Fry the fake chicken in the pan over medium-high heat. We don't need so much oil that it deep fries, but do use enough that it gets crunchy! The pan shouldn't ever look dry. If using a wok, you may need to work in 2-3 batches, as you can only cook one layer at the bottom of the pan at a time. When done, remove to another plate.
6. While the chicken is cooking, mix together the sauce ingredients as above
7. Reduce heat to medium low, and give the pan a minute to cool. Add a tbsp or two of oil if there isn't any left in the pan. Then, add the ginger and scallion whites, and stir-fry until aromatic, about 1 minute.
8. Increase heat to high and add the onion and serrano peppers. Stir fry for a few minutes more, until the onion is softened and seared in places.
9. Add the bell pepper and cook for another minute or two, until softened. Then, add the sauce, letting it sizzle against the pan. Cook for another minute or two, continuing to stir, until everything is coated in sauce.
10. Remove from heat, and taste for salt, adding more if needed. Add the green onion greens, letting the heat wilt them slightly. 
11. Serve with the rice!
