## Description
Rich and with a refreshing aftertaste!  If you have a craving for veggie potage ramen, you can make it easily just by combining together some common ingredients from your house.

## Yield: 
1 serving

## Ingredients:

**Broth:**
- 1 small sweet potato, peeled and coarsely chopped into ~3/4" pieces
- 1/2 small carrot, coarsely chopped
- 1/4 medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, sliced
- vegetable oil (for frying)
- 300ml (1.25 cup) water
- 1.25 tsp [fake chicken boullion](https://www.amazon.com/Better-Than-Bouillon-Chicken-Certified/dp/B000N7YKQK)
- one serving ramen noodles
- salt (how much?)
- soy sauce (shoyu) (how much?)

**Toppings:** (suggested)
- baked tofu or fake meat of choice
- shredded or chopped green onions (1-2)
- sliced tomatos (1 roma tomato)

## Directions:

1. Heat up a saucepan and put some vegetable oil in it.
2. Fry the sweet potato, carrot, yellow onion, and garlic with the lid on until some light browning is visible (4-5 minutes over medium heat*)
3. Transfer all ingredients from the pan into a blender.  Also add in the water and fake chicken boullion.

Todo: should we add some soft tofu as well to replace the chicken in the blender?

4. Blend until completely smooth.
5. Return mixture to the pan and simmer over medium-low heat for 5 minutes.  Be careful not to burn!
6. While the broth is simmering, start the noodles cooking according to package directions in another pot.
7. Add salt and soy sauce into the broth to taste.
8. Pour the broth into a bowl.  When the noodles are ready, carefully drain them and add to the bowl with the broth.  Mix well.
9. Add toppings as desired


* Medium heat is defined as the burner level where the tips of the flames just touch the bottom of the pot.

## Author's Note: Development of this Recipe
Considering that this recipe just used what I had in my house, this came out unexpectedly delicious.  For some reason, it actually tastes like [Tenka Ippin](https://www.tenkaippin.co.jp/) packaged ramen.  And it's surprisingly quick to put together!
