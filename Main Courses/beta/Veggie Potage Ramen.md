## Description
Rich and with a refreshing aftertaste!  If you have a craving for veggie potage ramen, you can make it easily just by combining together some common ingredients from your house.

## Yield: 
1 serving

## Ingredients:

**Broth:**
- 1/2 medium sweet potato, peeled and coarsely chopped into ~3/4" pieces
- 1/2 small carrot, coarsely chopped
- 1/4 medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, sliced
- vegetable oil (for frying)
- 300ml (1.25 cup) water
- 1.25 tsp [fake chicken boullion](https://www.amazon.com/Better-Than-Bouillon-Chicken-Certified/dp/B000N7YKQK)
- one serving ramen noodles (4oz fresh noodles, ??oz dry noodles)
- 1.5 tbsp Chinese soy sauce [I recommend Pearl River Bridge brand #notsponsored]
- 1 tsp sake (or other cooking alcohol such as mirin or cooking sherry)
- 1/4 tsp salt

**Toppings:** (suggested)
- baked tofu or fake meat of choice
- shredded or chopped green onions (1-2)
- sliced tomatoes (1 roma tomato)

## Directions:

1. Heat up a saucepan and put some vegetable oil in it.
2. Fry the sweet potato, carrot, yellow onion, and garlic with the lid on until some light browning is visible (4-5 minutes over medium heat*)
3. Transfer all ingredients from the pan into a blender.  Also add in the water, fake chicken boullion, sake, and salt.
4. Blend until completely smooth.
5. Return mixture to the pan and simmer over medium-low heat for 5 minutes.  Be careful not to burn!
6. While the broth is simmering, start the noodles cooking according to package directions in another pot.
8. Remove the broth from heat, add the soy sauce, and pour it into a bowl.  When the noodles are ready, carefully drain them and add to the bowl with the broth.  Mix well.
9. Add toppings as desired

\* Medium heat is defined as the burner level where the tips of the flames just touch the bottom of the pot.
