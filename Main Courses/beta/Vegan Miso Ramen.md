## Directions:

1. First, we will make the easy broth.  Preheat a pot over medium-high heat.
2. In a small bowl, mix together the minced garlic, miso, soy sauce, mirin, and sesame seeds with a fork until combined.
3. Quickly, lightly fry the miso mixture in the pot until the flavor is released, stirring constantly so it doesn't burn.

3. Before it burns, add the water and bring to a boil.
4. Mix in the fake chicken boullion and fake butter.
5. If you like it spicy, add a few teaspoons of doubanjiang paste.
6. In a separate pot, boil up the soumen noodles according to package directions, then drain and transfer to serving bowls.
7. Add the soup to the bowls
8. Add preferred toppings!  [Shichimi powder](https://www.amazon.com/cart/smart-wagon?newItems=d6b7f648-b73a-4399-916c-4ed9b437801b,1&ref_=sw_refresh) [Japanese seven-flavor chili powder] is often a good choice.
