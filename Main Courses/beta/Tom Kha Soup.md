Based on this: https://zardyplants.com/recipes/vegan-tom-kha-soup-thai-inspired/
But rewritten and optimized for flavor.

Changes:
- Use coconut cream instead of coconut milk for even stronger coconut flavor (+ cheaper too)
- Baby bella mushrooms &gt; shiitake
- Reduced amount of noodles and tofu as the soup felt like it was a little too packed
- Added baby corn!
- Put ingredients in usage order and group into sections

## Yield:
About 3-4 full meals

## Time:
~45-60 minutes

## Ingredients:

- ~4 oz dry vermicelli noodles.
    - There are a variety of kinds available, I rather like Korean japchae noodles

**Aromatics:**
- 2 inches galangal, grated
- 1 stalk lemongrass (or 1 tbsp [lemongrass paste](https://amzn.to/375PUa9))
    - To prepare a lemongrass stalk, first peel off the outer few layers until a tender, smooth surface is exposed.  Then, slice off and discard the green parts at the tops, keeping only the white and very light green parts (bottom 5-6 inches). Next, slice off the roots at the base. Finally, chop the stalk into thin rings and mince those rings a few times into even smaller pieces.
- 1 tbsp Thai red curry paste
- 3-4 cloves garlic, minced

**Stew:**
- neutral oil, for frying (~1 tbsp)
- 1 white onion, sliced into half-moons
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced into ~2cm x 5mm strips
- 1 lb baby bella mushrooms, sliced (cut large mushrooms into 4 slices and small ones in half)
- 1 can baby corn, drained
- 400 ml coconut cream
    - You can get this [online](https://www.amazon.com/Kara-Coconut-Cream-6-80-Units/dp/B00MH7UY5K?th=1) or at Asian grocery stores such as H-Mart
- 4 cups vegan chicken broth
- 1 block firm tofu, sliced into medium (~2cm) cubes
- ~4 kaffir (aka makrut) lime leaves

**Final Ingredients:**
- 6 tbsp lime juice (~2-3 medium limes)
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 3 tbsp white sugar (TODO maybe a little more?)
- Chopped cilantro for topping, maybe 1/2 cup loosely packed

## Directions:

1. Begin cooking the vermicelli noodles according to package directions.
2. Prepare the aromatics and add to one prep bowl. Slice the white onion into another bowl. Chop up the bell pepper and mushrooms into a third bowl.
3. Preheat a large pot over medium heat and add some of the neutral oil. Add the aromatics and fry, stirring frequently, until fragrant (1-2 minutes). The galangal may stick to the bottom of the pan, but this is OK.
4. Next, add the sliced onion and saute for another 2 minutes, until slightly softened. Then, add the mushrooms and bell peppers. Saute for about 5 minutes, until the mushrooms are starting to soften a bit. While this is going, you can chop up the tofu and juice the limes.
6. Now, add the baby corn, coconut cream, vegan chicken broth, and cubed tofu. Add the lime leaves as well, allowing them to float on the top of the soup like bay leaves. 
7. Bring to a simmer, then cook for ~7 more minutes.
8. Remove from heat and add the vermicelli noodles, lime juice, salt, and sugar.
9. Taste for seasoning, adding additional salt, sugar, or lime juice if necessary.
10. Serve, topping with cilantro!
