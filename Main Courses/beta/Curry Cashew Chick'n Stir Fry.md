# Curry Cashew Chick'n Stir Fry

This recipe is very much a blend of cultures. I, an American, got the sauce from Joanne Lee Molinaro's vegan Korean cookbook, who in turn said that she was inspired to make the recipe by Indian cuisine. So, it's come halfway around the world, and I think it's gotten better at each stop.

Molinaro's recipe is for rice cakes, which I found out that I didn't care for... after I tried them for the first time making the recipe. But while I was not a fan of the gelatinous rice cakes, I loved the sauce they were cooked in. This is a unique one -- it's somewhere between cashew butter and curry, and the flavor is hard to understand without making it. But trust me, it's worth a shot, and it's even better as part of a stir fry!

To kick this up another notch, I also borrowed a trick from one of Chloe Coscarelli's recipes -- using a second, mild broth-based sauce to add a little more flavor to the stir fry veggies.

## Ingredients
### Cashew Sauce
- 3/8 cup roasted cashews, soaked then drained
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 3/4 cup chopped onion (~1/2 small onion)
- 3/8 cup chopped red bell pepper (~3/8 med bell pepper)
- 4-5 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp ground cumin
- 2.25 tsp garam masala
- 3/8 tsp turmeric
- 1.5 tsp salt
- 3/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 1.5 tbsp gochujang paste
    - This gives a mild spice level. Feel free to increase if you like it spicier.
- 1.5 tbsp Japanese soy sauce (tamari) or Korean light soy sauce
- 1/4 cup vegetable broth (or 1/4 cup water and 1/4 tsp better than boullion)

### Chick'n
- 16-24 oz (~1 recipe) [The Best Vegan Chick'n](https://fullofplants.com/the-best-vegan-chickn/), shredded with your hands into chunks
- Olive oil (for frying)

### Stir Fry Sauce
- 1/4 cup vegetable broth
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp maple syrup
- 1 tbsp cornstarch

### Stir Fry
- Olive oil (for frying)
- 1 yellow onion, sliced (plus remaining onion from above)
- 1 yellow bell pepper, sliced (plus remaining bell pepper from above)
- 2 medium carrots, sliced into ~1/4" (6mm) thick rounds
- ~1 cup green beans, ends removed, sliced into 1"/3cm long pieces
- Rice of choice, about 1.5-2 cups dry

## Instructions

1. Start the cashews soaking in water. They should soak for at least 15 minutes minimum, but an hour is preferable. You can speed it up a bit by microwaving them for 30 seconds.
2. Start the rice according to package directions.
3. Next, chop up the veggies for the stir fry. They can all go in one bowl, as they will be cooked together. Also measure out the cashew sauce ingredients (you can add everything from the onion through the pepper to one prep bowl). Lastly, mix together the stir fry sauce.
4. Now, we can make the cashew sauce. In a frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high, until hot and shimmering. Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, garlic, drained cashews, cumin, garam masala, turmeric, salt, and black pepper. Saute until the onions begin to soften and the spices release their flavor, about 2-4 minutes.
5. Stir in the gochujang, then add the soy sauce, scraping up any toasty bits in the pan.
6. Scrape the mixture out of the skillet and into a small blender or food processor, then add the vegetable broth. (In my case, my regular Vitamix container was simply too big to blend this, but my vitamix dry grains bin worked great... just don't tell Vitamix I used it for wet ingredients!)
7. Blend until the sauce becomes smooth. It should take ~2 minutes of blending on high, but you might have to blend it for longer and slower due to how thick it is. Taste with a spoon when done to ensure that there is no remaining grittiness from the cashews -- if so, you need to blend more!
8. Now we can start the chick'n. In the same frying pan, add a tablespoon or two of oil, heat on medium-high, then add the shredded chick'n once the pan is hot. Fry for 2-3 minutes (until the bottom of each piece starts to char), then mix it up, then repeat 2-3 more times, until each piece is crispy and there's a little browning visible. You may add more oil if the pan looks dry.
9. While frying the chicken, heat up a wok or large frying pan over medium-high heat, add 2tbsp of oil, and add all the veggies. Stir-fry until the onions and carrots are softened, approx 7-10 minutes.
10. Once the chick'n has been made crispy, pour it into a bowl and add approximately half the cashew sauce. Mix until each chick'n piece is coated in sauce. Then, return to the frying pan, reduce heat to medium, and fry for a few minutes more on each side. We want to crisp up the sauce a bit, as that will add a delicious charred flavor.
11. Once the stir fry is done, reduce heat to medium-low and add the stir fry sauce. Mix it in and heat until it thickens, about 3 minutes.
12. Once the chick'n and rice are done, you are ready to serve! For each serving, add rice and stir fry, then top with chick'n, then finally pour the remaining sauce over the top.
