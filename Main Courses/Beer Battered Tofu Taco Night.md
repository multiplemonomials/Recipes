## Yield:
~5 full meals

## Ingredients:
### Spanish Rice
- 1/3 cup diced onion
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 1.25 cups long-grain parboiled rice.  I usually [buy this online](https://www.amazon.com/Zatarains-Grain-White-Cholesterol-Sodium/dp/B009NY53YC?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&th=1) but apparently you can also find it at Indian markets.
- 2 cups fake chicken broth (I use [No Chicken Better Than Boullion](https://www.amazon.com/Better-Than-Bouillon-Chicken-Certified/dp/B000N7YKQK))
- 1 cup water
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- .25 tsp cumin
- .25 tsp garlic powder
- .5 tsp salt

### Refried (but not actually fried) Beans
- 2 tbsp refined coconut oil (careful not to use unrefined!  It tastes like coconuts!).
- 1 small yellow onion, diced.  Can use a medium onion here and divide a bit for the rice & guacamole recipes.
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- .25 cup (packed) finely chopped fresh cilantro
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- .5 tsp salt
- 24-30 oz canned pinto beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 cup vegetable broth, divided
- 3 tbsp tomato paste

### Tofu
- Grapeseed or other neutral oil (for frying the tofu)
- 24 oz (2 packs) extra-firm tofu, pressed then cut into ~0.5 inch / 15mm cubes
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups chopped tomato (heirloom preferred)
- 0.25 cup (packed) finely chopped cilantro
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp agave nectar, or artificial sweetener equivalent to 1 tbsp sugar
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast flakes
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground chipotle powder (I cut this in half for my GF who doesn't like spice)
- 1 cup brown ale.  I like to use Guiness Draught Stout, e.g. [this kind](https://drizly.com/beer/ale/stout/dry-stout/guinness-draught/p4919)
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 4 cups loosely packed spinach (optional)

### Guacamole
- 2 avocados
- 1 tbsp chopped cilantro
- 1/4 cup diced tomato
- Juice of 0.5-1 lime (I like half a lime but my GF likes more)
- 2 tbsp diced onion
- 0.25 tsp salt
- a few grinds red pepper

### For Serving
- 0.5 cups fake sour cream (I like Tofutti brand, of which this uses half a container)
- Hot sauce, as needed
- If you want to make a taco salad:
  - Corn chips
  - Lettuce or other greens (optional)
- If you want to make soft tacos:
  - 10 medium size tortillas

## Procedure:

### Prep & Rice
1. Slice one onion into half-moons for the tofu.  Dice up the second onion for the beans and rice.
2. Next we'll start the rice, because that needs to cook for a while.  Heat up a saucepan or small pot over medium-high heat with the olive oil, then add 1/3 cup of diced onion.  Saute for a few minutes until the onion becomes tender and translucent.  Then, add the parboiled rice and saute for 3-5 minutes until the rice becomes opaque.
3. Add the remaining rice ingredients.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer with the lid on for 20-25 minutes until the water is gone and the rice is cooked.  If the rice is still tough when the water is gone, just add more water and keep simmering.  Once done, keep in a covered container until everything else is ready.
4. Start the tofu pressing.  Each block should press for at least 10 minutes to get most of the water out.
5. Chop up the tomatoes for the tofu and the guac.  Note that the tomatoes for the guac need to be chopped fairly small, while for the tofu you can get away with big pieces because they'll be cooked down.
6. Chop up the cilantro for the tofu, beans, and guac.
7. Mince the garlic for the tofu and beans.
8. Juice the lemon for the tofu and juice the lime for the guac.
9. When the tofu is done pressing, chop it up into ~0.5 inch cubes.

### Beans
10. Next, we will make the beans.  Heat the coconut oil in a saucepan or small pot over medium heat (you can reuse the pot from the rice if it's done).  Add the diced onion (keeping 2 tbsp for the guac) and saute until translucent (3-5 minutes).  
11. Add the garlic to a clear spot on the pan and let it sizzle until fragrant.  Then, mix in the cilantro, cumin, oregano, and salt and saute for another minute or so until the cilantro is wilted.
12. Add the pinto beans and half of the vegetable broth.  Let the beans heat up for a few minutes.  Then, use a big fork or mini potato masher to mash them against the sides of the pot.  This will take a few minutes, getting a helper is recommended.  When it's done, the mixture should be thick, but not pureed -- you want to still see some visible bean shapes in there.
13. Add the tomato paste and enough vegetable broth to keep the mixture liquid.  Cover and cook for about 10 more minutes, stirring periodically and gradually adding the rest of the broth.  Then, remove from heat and keep covered until ready to serve.

### Pan-Fried Tofu
14. Now we'll fry up the tofu. Heat a large frying pan or wok over medium-high heat and add in a few tablespoons of grapeseed oil, giving it a few minutes to come up to temperature.
15. Then, add the tofu.  On top of the tofu, sprinkle a pinch or two of salt and a few grinds of black pepper.  Then, add in the cornstarch and thoroughly mix everything together so that the cornstarch is coating the tofu and there are no large clumps of starch left (you don't want to make fried cornstarch!).
16. Spread the tofu evenly around the pan so that each cube is touching the metal.  
17. Set a timer for 2 minutes 30 seconds and leave the tofu alone until it expires.  I mean it, don't even think about messing with it. If you don't leave it alone long enough, it won't get crispy.
18. When the timer goes off, stir up the tofu with a spoon.  Also, add more oil if the pan seems dry,  Then, go back to step 15 and repeat the process 3-4 times until the tofu is suitably crispy.
19. Once the tofu is done, remove it from the pan and place it on a plate covered with a paper towel (to soak up excess oil).

### Tofu Filling
20. In the frying pan, saute the sliced onion in olive oil over medium heat until some browning is visible, ~5-7 min
21. Add the garlic to a clear spot on the pan and cook until it's fragrant.  Add the chopped tomatoes, cilantro, salt, agave/sweetener, nutritional yeast, cumin, and chipotle powder and cook for another 5 minutes, until the tomatoes are broken down and have released their juice.
22. Add the ale and increase the heat to medium-high.  Once the ale starts to boil off, cook for about 2 minutes to reduce the liquid, then reduce heat to medium.
23. Add the tofu back to the pan and toss to coat.  Heat through for a minute or two, then turn off the heat.
24. Add the lemon juice.  If using the spinach, add it in in handfuls, allowing it to wilt and mixing it in with the filling.

### Guacamole
25. Lastly we'll prepare the guac.  Cut each avocado in half using a table knife, then scoop out all the filling with a spoon.  Remove the pits but don't throw them away!
26. In a sealable container, mix together all the guacamole ingredients.  Then, re-add the pits to the container, since they help keep the guac fresh for longer.

### Serve!
27. Once you've finished the rice, beans, tofu filling, and guac, set them out for people to grab along with the sour cream!
28. If making soft tacos, warm the tortillas up in a toaster oven, then let people make their tacos with whatever fillings they want!
29. Or, if making taco salads, prepare a bowl of greens and crumbled corn chips, then add everything else on top.
