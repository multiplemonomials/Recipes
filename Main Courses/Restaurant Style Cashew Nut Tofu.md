# Restaurant Style Cashew Nut Tofu

I must confess: I have an addiction.  And it's one I have been struggling with for some time now.  But it's not booze or drugs or any of the normal vices -- it's to cashew nut tofu.  My local thai restaurant has the best cashew nut tofu I've ever had in my life, and I get it almost every time I go there.  When I first tried it, it was like nothing else I've ever had before -- the sauce accentuates the savory flavors of tofu, green onions, garlic, and cooked cashews, but doesn't overpower them.  And somehow, it manages to be almost sweet and savory at the same time.

For years I have been helplessly beholden to this restaurant for this one dish, and have dragged many of my friends there to try it as well.  But gradually, I've learned to cook the various pieces that go into cashew nut tofu, and now I think I can finally create my own copycat recipe.

When researching this recipe, I had to dip into the non-vegan world, and was eventually able to find [this dish](https://www.eatingthaifood.com/thai-cashew-chicken-recipe/) by EatingThaiFood, which seems to most closely approximate what my local restaurant is serving.  However, I did add some extra ingredients (rice vinegar and a bit of MSG) to the sauce to give it a bit more punch (and don't worry, the current research seems to be that MSG is not bad for you in normal quantities).  Then, I combined it with the tofu from my Restaurant-Style Eggplant Tofu recipe, and gave it a shot!  This recipe might not be quite as decadent as the one from my local restaurant, but I think that it does replicate the same flavor and is pretty much guaranteed to impress.

## Yield: 
4 servings

## Ingredients:

**Tofu:**
- 2 blocks firm tofu, not pressed, cut into ~2" x ~2" x 1/2" rectangular prisms.  Firm preferred but extra-firm will also work.
- 4 cups water
- 3 tsp salt
- Vegetable oil for frying (I use grapeseed), at least 1/2 cup

**Sauce:**
- 1.5tbsp vegetarian oyster sauce (e.g. [this](https://www.amazon.com/Vegetarian-Mushroom-Oyster-Sauce-35fl/dp/B00LBLYMMO/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1RNNN6LG712U9&dchild=1&keywords=vegetarian+oyster+sauce&qid=1601347380&sprefix=vegetarian+oys%2Caps%2C190&sr=8-3))
- 1.5tsp dark soy sauce (e.g. [this](https://www.amazon.com/Pearl-River-Bridge-Superior-16-9-Ounce/dp/B01I4CVE8C/ref=sr_1_1_pp?crid=1UG7W24MPKKR3&keywords=pearl+river+bridge+dark+soy+sauce&qid=1707120023&s=grocery&sprefix=pearl+river+bridge+dark+soy+sauc%2Cgrocery%2C149&sr=1-1)) (This is a thicker, sweeter variant of soy sauce.  It tastes kind of like if you mixed regular soy sauce with molasses.  Unlike regular soy sauce, it must be stored in the fridge.)
- 1 tbsp vegan fish sauce (e.g. [this](https://www.amazon.com/Oceans-Halo-Sauce-Vegan-Ounce/dp/B07RWVTYQZ/ref=sr_1_23_f3_0o_wf?keywords=vegan+fish+sauce&qid=1707120123&sr=8-23))
- 1/4 tsp stevia (equivalent to 1.5 tsp white sugar)
- 4.5 tbsp water
- 1/16 tsp MSG (I use half of a 1/8 tsp measure)
- 1/2 tsp rice vinegar (TODO, maybe try a little more next time)

**Stir Fry:**
- 1.5 cups dry white rice (equivalent to 2 Zojirushi rice maker cups)
- 1 cup cashews.  You can use pre-roasted cashews here, but I prefer to use unroasted because cooking them fresh gives them a bit more flavor.  Also I generally use cashew pieces because I already buy them in bulk for making fake cheese.
- 4 whole dried szechuan chilies.  These give just a hint of spice to the dish.  You can chop them up (just shake out and toss the seeds!) if you want to get even more spice out of them.
- 8 cloves garlic, minced
- ~18 green onions, white and green parts, cut into 1.5 inch lengths
- Sesame seeds, for topping

## Directions:

1. First, start the rice cooking in a rice maker or pot.
2. In a saucepan, bring 4 cups water to a boil and add the salt.  Add in the tofu slices and allow them to steam in the water for 3-5 minutes once the water returns to a boil.  This infuses them with salt, making them extremly tasty.
3. Use a slotted spoon to remove the tofu to a bowl or colander and allow a few minutes for it to cool off.
4. Heat up a wok or frying pan over medium heat and add enough vegetable oil to create a 1/4" deep pool of oil (half the height of the slices of tofu).  When the oil is hot and shimmering, add as many tofu pieces as will fit.  Allow the tofu to fry until a golden crust develops on the bottom, ~4 minutes.  Then, flip each piece and fry until the other side looks similar, ~3 minutes.

5. Transfer the fried tofu pieces to a plate with a paper towel on it (which will soak up excess oil).  Then, cut each square along its diagonals, forming four small triangles.
6. Repeat for the remaining tofu until all of it is fried.  
7. If you are using unroasted cashews, you can cook them now in the hot oil.  Simply pour in some cashews, then watch carefully until they start to turn golden.  It should take between 1 minute and 1 minute 30 seconds.  Quickly remove them using a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl.  I might recommend doing this in 2-3 batches so if you mess up, you haven't wasted as many cashews.  This took me a few tries to get the hang of, they cook faster than you would think!
8. Pour off most of the remaining oil in the wok into a heatproof container, leaving just a tablespoon or so.  This oil can be put in the fridge and reused (though it will taste slightly of cashews).  Reduce the heat in the wok to low and allow it to cool for a few minutes (don't want to burn the garlic!).
9. In a small bowl, stir together the sauce ingredients and set aside.
10. Add the garlic and szechuan chilies to the pan and fry for 30 seconds until fragrant.  Be careful not to let the garlic go crunchy; add the onions immediately to cool down the pan if it starts to turn golden.
11. Add the green onions, increase heat to medium, and stir fry until the onions begin to break down (it should take 5-8 minutes).  You'll know the onions are ready when you can tap on a white part with a spoon and the inner sections pop out.

12. Add the roasted cashews, tofu, and sauce.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until everything is coated in sauce and the sauce at the bottom is bubbly.

13. Serve!  Plate into bowls along with the rice, and top with sesame seeds and the remaining green onions.
