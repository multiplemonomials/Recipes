# Quick-Set Ricotta Pizza Cheeze
This is another fake cheeze recipe for pizzas. It's similar to Quick-Set Mozzarella, except it has a more neutral flavor. I find that it can be better for people who don't like the tast of most fake cheezes. It will fade into the background, letting the other ingredients in your pizza shine through!

_Fake Meat_ p. 290

## Yield:
Enough cheeze for one largeish pizza (~1.5 cups)

## Ingredients:
- .5 cup (60 g) unroasted cashews
- .5 cup (55 g) slivered almonds (regular almonds with skin will NOT work, you have to use slivered!)
- 7/8 cup water (3/4 cup plus 2 tbsp)
- 1.5 tsp onion powder
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- .5 tsp salt
- 1.5 tsp lambda carrageenan
- 1.5 tsp tapioca starch

## Directions:
1. Add everything except the tapioca starch and carrageenan to a high-speed blender and blend until completely smooth -- this will likely take several minutes.  Make sure to scrape down the sides once or twice with a spatula to grab any nut fragments that escaped.  When finished, taste the mixture to ensure that there's no grittiness remaining.  If there is, you need to keep blending.
2. Ensure the mixture is not hot -- it might be depending on how long you blended it for.  If it's warmer than lukewarm, shove it in the freezer for a few minutes to ensure that the carrageenan won't activate yet.
3. Add the tapioca starch and carrageenan, then blend until incorporated, perhaps 20 seconds.
4. Let the cheeze mixture sit until you're ready to make your pizza.  Once you have rolled out your dough and spread tomato sauce on top as desired, then you can continue.
5. Pour the cheeze from the blender onto the pizza.  Use it sparingly at first until you have covered the entire pizza -- you don't want to run out before finishing the pizza!  Cheeze will still be a liquid at this stage.
6. Top your pizza with desired toppings, and bake!
7. When you remove the pizza from the oven, like magic, the cheeze will have set!  (note that I've only tested this with baking my pizza in a normal oven, so it's in there for 10-15 minutes.  I'm not totally sure how this will work if you have a proper pizza oven)
