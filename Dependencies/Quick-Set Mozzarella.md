# Quick-Set Mozzarella Pizza Cheeze

Until I started reading _Fake Meat_ by Isa C. M., I didn't even realize it was possible to make one's own fake cheese.  However, now that I have, I can say that not only is it possible, it isn't even that difficult!  As I learned, there are two keys to making homemade vegan cheeze that works.  For texture, we use gelling agents like tapioca starch and carrageenan.  These ingredients wait until the cheeze is heated, then bind it together into a gel with a consistency similar to cheese.  And for flavor, fermented ingredients like nutritional yeast, red miso, and apple cider vinegar can be used to create a cheeze with realistic flavor.

Isa's cookbook uses a specific process for making vegan cheeze, where you start with a base of blended water and cashews, add gelling and flavoring ingredients, and then heat in a saucepot until the gelling agent activates and the cheeze thickens.  But, what I realized is, if you're making a pizza, you can actually *skip* the last step, because the pizza gets hot enough in the oven to activate the cheeze anyway.  In fact, vegan cheeze doesn't re-melt that well in the oven, so doing it this way will actually help you get a much more uniform cheeze spread than you can get from making the cheeze normally and shredding it.  The result is kinda amazing to watch -- it goes into the oven as a liquid, and comes out as a firm cheese!  It's kinda like quick-set concrete.

## Yield:
Enough cheeze for one largeish pizza (~1.5 cups)

## Ingredients:
- 100 g unroasted cashews (~a heaping 3/4 cup).  Unroasted is important, otherwise it will not taste right.
- 7/8 cup water (3/4 cup plus 2 tbsp)
- 4 tsp refined coconut oil, melted
- 2 tsp apple cider vinegar
- 2 tsp lemon juice
- 4 tsp nutritional yeast
- 3/4 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 4 tsp tapioca starch (e.g. [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Tapioca-Starch-Powder-16-Pack/dp/B007EFOEOW/ref=sr_1_5_pp?keywords=tapioca+starch&qid=1703058760&sr=8-5))
- 1.5 tsp lambda carrageenan (e.g. [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Carrageenan-Molecular-Gastronomy-Non-GMO-Certified/dp/B07CZ2STF2/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3VJBDUD6ZC9GM&keywords=labda%2Bcarrageenan&qid=1703058795&sprefix=labda%2Bcarrageenan%2Caps%2C143&sr=8-3&th=1)).  Yes it's a little expensive but one bag will last a long time.  I believe that kappa carrageenan will also work but might get a harder cheese than intended.

## Directions:
1. Add everything except the tapioca starch and carrageenan to a high-speed blender and blend until completely smooth -- this will likely take several minutes.  Make sure to scrape down the sides once or twice with a spatula to grab any cashew fragments that escaped.  When finished, taste the mixture to ensure that there's no grittiness remaining.  If there is, you need to keep blending.
2. Ensure the mixture is not hot -- it might be depending on how long you blended it for.  If it's warmer than lukewarm, shove it in the freezer for a few minutes to ensure that the carrageenan won't activate yet.
3. Add the tapioca starch and carrageenan, then blend until incorporated, perhaps 20 seconds.
4. Let the cheeze mixture sit until you're ready to make your pizza.  Once you have rolled out your dough and spread tomato sauce on top as desired, then you can continue.
5. Pour the cheeze from the blender onto the pizza.  Use it sparingly at first until you have covered the entire pizza -- you don't want to run out before finishing the pizza!  Cheeze will still be a liquid at this stage.
6. Top your pizza with desired toppings, and bake!
7. When you remove the pizza from the oven, like magic, the cheeze will have set!  (note that I've only tested this with baking my pizza in a normal oven, so it's in there for 10-15 minutes.  I'm not totally sure how this will work if you have a proper pizza oven)
