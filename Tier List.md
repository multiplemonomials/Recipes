# Jamie's Mega Vegan Recipe Tier List

## The Tiers

| Tier | Description |
|---|---|
| S | Recipes that transcend the realm of mortal flavor and transport you to a new dimension of fabulous taste.  Guaranteed to impress absolutely anyone. |
| A | Recipes that are at least as good as a good restaurant.  Should impress just about anyone. |
| B | Recipes that are quite tasty and which most people should like. |
| C | Recipes which might be worth making once or twice, but didn't fully appeal to me and may only exist to replicate a non-vegan flavor or food. |

## Work Amounts
Using a 1-10 scale for work amounts.
- 1 means you reheat it and eat it
- 2 would be equivalent to packaged (non instant) ramen, where you boil noodles and chop up some toppings and you can be done in under 15 min.
- 5 would be something like standard stir fry or pasta, where you have to chop up some veggies and cook for an hour or so
- 8 would be something which requires making pre-recipes, managing multiple dishes at the same time, doing pastry crusts, etc.

## Servings Made
For this I will assume that the recipe is the *only* thing one is eating for a given mean, i.e. no side dishes.  This generally means my serving counts can be lower than what's printed in the cookbooks.

# Main Courses
## S Tier
| Name | Servings Made (single batch) | Amount of Work | How well does it keep in fridge? | Source | Description | Dependencies/Sides |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Penne Vodka | 6 | 4 | Well | I Can Cook Vegan p. 44 | Creamy pasta dish with delicious chunks of basil and garlic mixed in.  The cashew cream makes it soooo filling. | |
| Impossible Meat Lomo Saltado | 3 | 6 | Decent, as long as you keep the rice separate | Impossible, The Cookbook p. 101 | Savory dish which combines Asian flavors (soy sauce, rice) and Mexican elements (yellow chili paste, tomatoes, cilantro). | |
| Tahini Chipotle Hash Browns | 3 | 4 | Well | Isa Does It p. 249 | Savory, spicy potatoes plus vegan sausage with an INCREDIBLY flavorful tahini miso sauce on top.  What's not to love?  (warning: make sure to decrease spice level in original recipe if you are not good with spice.  I use 1/2 the amount or less.)| |
| Beer Battered Tofu Vegan Taco Night | 5 | 7 | Well, as long as chips/taco shells are stored separately | [This Repo](https://github.com/multiplemonomials/Recipes/blob/master/Main%20Courses/Beer%20Battered%20Tofu%20Taco%20Night.md) | Vegan tacos or taco salads bursting with flavor from fresh beans, spanish rice, tangy battered tofu, and guac. | |
| Cajun Jambalaya | 3 | 5 | Very well | The Cajun Vegan Cookbook p. 109 | Imagine a rice pilaf, with parboiled rice and veggies.  Then make it even better, with spicy mayo sauce, fresh veggies, and sauteed vegan sausages.  This is EXTREMELY easy to double/triple/quadruple when feeding lots of people. | Cali-Cajun Sauce (aka spicy mayo), Cajun Seasoning |

## A Tier
| Name | Servings Made (single batch) | Amount of Work | How well does it keep in fridge? | Source | Description | Dependencies/Sides |

| Vegan Miso Ramen | 2 | 3 | Broth will keep but you will want to make the noodles "to order" | [This Repo](https://github.com/multiplemonomials/Recipes/blob/master/Main%20Courses/Vegan%20Miso%20Ramen.md) | Flavorful miso and noodle base which you can customize with all sorts of toppings.  Recipe based on a top scorer on cookpad (Japanese allrecipes) | |
| Pad Ka-Prao | 3 | 4 | Decent, as long as you keep the rice separate | Impossible, The Cookbook p. 80 | Imagine a sort of impossible meat burger filling absolutely bursting with licorice-y thai basil flavor, served on top of rice.  That's this in a nutshell. | Rice |
| Indonesian Steamed Rice (Nasi Goreng) with Tofu | 4-5 | 5 | Okay, but the tofu will get soggy if not eaten immediately | [This Repo](https://github.com/multiplemonomials/Recipes/blob/master/Main%20Courses/Nasi%20Goreng%20-%20Indonesian%20Steamed%20Rice%20with%20Tofu.md) | Sometimes you just want something light and easy on the stomach, with no spiciness and no strong flavors.  This mellow veggie stir fry manages to still be delicious while only containing gentle turmeric, sumac, and pepper flavors. | |
